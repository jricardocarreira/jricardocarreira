**Product Designer focused on UX, UI, and building real-world products.**  
I create digital and physical products from concept to operation, combining design, technology, and storytelling.

Here you’ll find frontend projects, UI experiments, and tools that are part of my product-making process, alongside experiments that mix design, graffiti, and content creation.

I use content as part of the product: to explain, test, improve, and build community around what I create.
